# Drivers-STM32F4
Library containing drivers for handling peripherals on the STM32F407G-DISC1 board (stm32f407vg processor). The library was built on the basis of the Datasheet and Reference manual and the online course.

## Drivers include:
- GPIO drivers
- SPI drivers
- I2C drivers
- UART drivers

### GPIO Drivers APIs requirements:
*** - GPIO initialization ***
*** - Enable/Disable GPIO port clock ***
*** - Read From a GPIO Pin ***
*** - Write to GPIO Pin ***
*** - Configure alternate functionality ***
*** - Interrupt Handling ***
